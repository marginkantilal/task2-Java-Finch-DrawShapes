# task2-Java-Finch-DrawShapes

********** MY FIRST YEAR UNIVERSITY PROJECT **********  

The purpose of this project is to make the Finch robot to draw shapes. The program should only accept the valid command. If the input is wrong, the program should display an erorr message asking the user to re-enter the valid command. The program should accept the length between 15cm to 75cm and if it is not then it should display an error message and ask the user to renter valid length. Finally if the user has chosen the shape and entered the valid length, it then should start drawing the chosen shape. The program should store the log execution in a text file including the shape name, it's size, time took to draw the shape, and more.

I successfully managed to complete the project and and achieved higher in this project.
